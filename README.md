# RFID Lock System

The main Goal of this project it to develop a system whick cotrols a door-lock with a relay.
To unlock the door successfully you need to place three different RFID tags in
specific rfid reader's potitions . 

## Getting Started

The wiringn is described in the source code (<project_folder>/src) 
An LCD is used for testing the status of the system .

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

## Future plans

1. Extend the range of RFID reader 
2. Add tow more RFID readers 
3. power the relay only when specific RFID tags are present
